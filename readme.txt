Displays random Bible verse (KJV) on page-load and refresh with widget.

== Description ==

This plugin displays a random Bible verse via the widget. Each time the applicable page is loaded or refreshed, the widget randomly selects a new verse. The current algorithm allows for the same verse to show up multiple times in a row. If you arenâ€™t seeing a different verse, just refresh the page a few more times.

The plugin creates a widget that can be used in sidebars, footers, and other widget locations. There is no shortcode yet, but that is coming in a future version. The plugin is easy to install and there are no configuration options to worry about.

All verses are King James Version and currently English is the only supported language.

== Translations ==

= English =

* King James Version (KJV)
