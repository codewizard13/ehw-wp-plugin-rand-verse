Displays random Bible verse (KJV) on page-load as widget.

== Description ==

This plugin displays a random Bible verse via the widget. Each time the page the widget is on is loaded or refreshed, the widget randomly selects a new verse. The current algorighm allows for the same verse to show up multiple times in a row. If you aren't seeing a different verse, just refresh the page a few more times. Currently, that is how it works. Future improvements are forthcoming.

All verses are King James Version and currently English is the only supported language.

The plugin creates a widget that can be used in sidebars, footers, and other widget locations. There is no shortcode yet, but that is coming in a future version. The plugin is easy to install and there are no configuration options to worry about.
